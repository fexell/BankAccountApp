## OOP / Encapsulation
### OOP,
or "object oriented programming", is a way to structure your code, make code (like methods) reusable, keep the code organized, and more easily maintainable.

### Encapsulation,
is all about exposing only what is necessary to be exposed. It ensures data (like internal state) is "hidden."
